# Proposal

Advanced Embedded Systems (Embedded Systems with RTOS) is currently in development for its first trial in Fall 2023. It will need labs, projects, and assignments planned, as well as accompanying lecture material. Its labs, projects, & assignments will be written using c/c++ on a platform called PlatformIO, which is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux; this will allow greater flexibility for students and a flexible, transparent environment to learn Zephyr RTOS, the RTOS I propose using in the MS project and the course I would design the labs for. While writing the labs for Advanced Embedded Systems, the lab for Embedded Systems (ECE 5780/6780) could similarly be rewritten, and labs for a potential course titled _OS for Embedded Systems_ could be prepared, as well. As simply writing labs & projects for Advanced Embedded Systems likely won't provide the workload necessary for 18 hours/week of work, I propose the following goals:

1. Rewrite **Embedded Systems** (ECE 5780/6780) labs for Platformio [(Bare Metal Embedded Systems)](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/01.bare-metal/)
2. Write labs for **Advanced Embedded Systems** [(RTOS on Embedded Systems)](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/)
3. Write labs for **Operating Systems for Embedded Systems** [(OS for Embedded Systems)](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/03.os/)
