# Proposal

Ashton Snelgrove has experience working with certain _chemo-resistive sensors_ (components whose resistance varies as a result of interaction with known chemicals). He has worked to evaluate their performance with large computer systems, but sees lots of potential applications in diverse industries dependent upon a wearable, embedded sytem application. That is the goal of this MS research project; it is to:

_effectively interact with the chemo-resistive sensors within the constraints of a wearable device such that the following constraints are met:_
- **Reactivity:** The sensor has to react in time for subject's knowledge to be actionable.
- **Size:** The sensor area must not exceed than 16 square inches.
- **Battery life:** The sensor battery life must exceed 8 hours (a typical work day)
- **Weight:** The sensor weight (including power source) must not exceed 2 pounds.

## Stretch Goals
1. Bluetooth connection (to alert phone or other connected device)
2. Increase Battery Life
3. Sensor Networks (I'd have to look into low-powered wireless sensor network options)
