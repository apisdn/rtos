### FPGA-Processor Combo _(I'd suggest this route)_

I suggest the MiniZed, due to performance and price.

- [Zybo Z7](https://digilent.com/shop/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/)
  - Pros:
    - dual-core Cortex-A9 processor
    - I have experience w/ it
    - Artix-7 FPGA - equivalent
    - HDMI
    - USB
    - Ethernet
    - 1GB DDR3L w 32-bit bus
  - Cons:
    - Expensive: $\ge \$300$
- [MiniZed](https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/minized/)
  - Pros:
    - Inexpensive: $\lt$ 100
    - Wi-Fi
    - Bluetooth
    - Contains Processor-FPGA combo
- [Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board](https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/)
  - Pros:
    - Suggested by digilent for newbies
- [StepFPGA](https://a.co/d/dHU2DfJ)
  - Pros:
    - Cheapest yet - ~\$60

_Assuming FPGA & Custom Device Drivers are desired, I suggest the MiniZed._ This link allows for [custom embedded board configuration](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/platforms/creating_board.html)

### Purely Processor

Linux functions best with [$\ge$ 16 MB RAM](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/before.html#:~:text=You%20need)

- STM32
- RaspberryPi (This may skip compilation of Linux, but device drivers would still be possible)
  - [rPi Pico](https://a.co/d/hFUy93P)
- [Nuvoton Chili](https://direct.nuvoton.com/en/numaker-rtu-nuc980-chili-board)
