# Resources

The course hardware resources are dependent on the decision between the following two coursework options:

1. Create Hardware, then write drivers for it.
2. Write drivers for known hardware.

## Textbook

[Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/)

## 1. Create Hardware _and_ Drivers _(I think this route would be cool)_

### Boards

I suggest the Cora Z7, due to performance and price. The MiniZed is no longer sold.

- The Raspberry Pi Pico is too small, I misunderstood the RAM capabilities
  - We could use a Raspberry Pi ($\ge$ 50) and the [Sipeed Tang Nano 9k ($25)](https://a.co/d/g7d4rhV) to come to a total of $\ge 75$
- [Zybo Z7](https://digilent.com/shop/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/)
  - Pros:
    - dual-core Cortex-A9 processor
    - I have experience w/ it
    - Artix-7 FPGA - equivalent
    - HDMI
    - USB
    - Ethernet
    - 1GB DDR3L w 32-bit bus
  - Cons:
    - Expensive: $\ge \$300$
- [Cora Z7](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cora-z7/start)
  - _I think this one's the best idea_
  - Pros:
    - Inexpensive: $\lt \$100$
    - Wi-Fi
    - Bluetooth
    - Contains Processor-FPGA combo
  - Cons:
    - EOL is unknown?
      - _(The Cora Z7-10 variant is now retired in our store. The Cora Z7-07S is not affected and will remain in production.)_

_Assuming FPGA & Custom Device Drivers are desired, I suggest the MiniZed._ This link allows for [custom embedded board configuration](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/platforms/creating_board.html)

### Development Tools

## 2. Only Software

### Boards

Linux functions best with [$\ge$ 16 MB RAM](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/before.html#:~:text=You%20need)

- STM32
  - You would need to add $\ge 4MB$ RAM and Flash in order for the OS to run; likely $\ge 16 MB$. In addition, code would need to be added to the bootloader in order to find the added RAM & Flash.
- RaspberryPi (This may skip compilation of Linux, but device drivers would still be possible)
  - [rPi Pico](https://a.co/d/hFUy93P) (Not an option; doesn't run Linux--I was less right)
  - Raspberry Pis tend to cost $\ge \$50$
- [Nuvoton Chili](https://direct.nuvoton.com/en/numaker-rtu-nuc980-chili-board)
